# VulVR
This repository contains prototypes for VulVR projects. The [main page](https://developdata.github.io/VulVR/) is empty at the moment, with the projects coming off that.

## Audio
[This project](https://developdata.github.io/VulVR/audio/) uses an AI model created on [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to play sounds when the camera sees a square.
